Installs `bosh-init` and all its dependencies.

## Requirements

For `bosh-init` to run, the following files should be mounted as one or several volumes.

### BOSH manifest
YAML file defining BOSH configuration details. Passed as argument to `bosh-init deploy`.

### State file
Generated by `bosh-init` to keep track of the deployed BOSH instance. It must reside in the same directoy as the BOSH manifest.

### Private key
Used by `bosh-init` to ssh to BOSH. Its path is referenced in the BOSH manifest under the key: `cloud_provider.ssh_tunnel.private_key`. It is relative to the manifest directory.

Not necessary if *ssh_tunnel* is configured with the *password* option in the BOSH manifest.

### [Optional] bosh-init cache
It contains downloads and compiled packages. Reusing it saves significant time.
Always under `/root/.bosh_init`.

## Build locally

```
$ cd bosh-init
$ docker build -t bosh-init .
```

## Run

Example:

```
$ ls -Ra docker-bosh-init-manifest/
docker-bosh-init-manifest/:
.  ..  .ssh  bosh-manifest-state.json  bosh-manifest.yml

docker-bosh-init-manifest/.ssh:
.  ..  id_rsa

$ grep private_key docker-bosh-init-manifest/bosh-manifest.yml 
    private_key: .ssh/id_rsa

# Run locally
$ docker run -v /home/ubuntu/docker-bosh-init-manifest:/docker-bosh-init-manifest \
-v /home/ubuntu:docker-bosh-init-cache:/root/.bosh_init bosh-init \
bosh-init deploy /docker-bosh-init-manifest/bosh-manifest.yml

# Run from Dockerhub image
$ docker run -v /home/ubuntu/docker-bosh-init-manifest:/docker-bosh-init-manifest \
-v /home/ubuntu:docker-bosh-init-cache:/root/.bosh_init governmentpaas/bosh-init:latest \
bosh-init deploy /docker-bosh-init-manifest/bosh-manifest.yml
